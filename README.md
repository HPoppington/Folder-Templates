# Folder Templates

A simple command line utility & winforms app to create folder structures based on templates.

## Installation (Windows)

### Install the App
1) Download the [latest release](https://github.com/HPoppington/Folder-Templates/releases).
1) Extract zip file to your preferred application path (recommended "C:\Users\\[Your_User_Name]\AppData\Local\Folder Templates")
  - Note: overwrite files if you're upgrading
  - Hint: type %LocalAppData% into Windows Wxplorer to find your user's AppData path

### Install the "Send To" shortcut (automatic)
If this is your first install, and you'd like to access Folder Templates from your Windows "Send To" menu (recommended):
1) Run FolderTemplates.App.exe
1) In the menu, select File -> Options -> Add to Send To

### Install the "Send To" shortcut (manual)
If you'd like to customize your Send To shortcut for some reason:
1) Right-click on "FolderTemplates.App.exe" and select "Copy"
1) Open the "Send To" folder by typing "shell:sendto" in the Windows Explorer address bar
1) Right-click in the "Send To" folder and select "Paste Shortcut"
1) Rename the new Shortcut to your preferred "Send To" command name (e.g. "Folder Templates")

Once the shortcut is installed, you'll have something like this:
